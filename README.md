## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice **BEM methodology** and apply **responsive design** with `flexbox` and media queries.  
I also learned how to handle **border-radius with images** using `overflow: hidden` and how to align icons with text inside a button using `flexbox`.

```css
.product__button {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on:

- Improving responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox
- Mastering accessibility and semantic HTML
- Writing cleaner and more scalable CSS
